A day at Guru Nanak Dev Engineering Collage 
Date-19-07-2024
At the onset of the day, the college  would kick off by opening with a class on Universal Human Values to put a thoughtful spin on the morning.
After the lecture, we had a 30-minute break to explore the beautiful campus and its facilities.
Next, we joined a peer interaction session until 12:30 PM, where a friendly second-year senior told us about the collegeâ€™s exam system, clubs, and activities. 
This session gave us a good glimpse of what to expect. 
After gathering this information, we wrapped up our day and headed home, feeling a bit more comfortable and familiar with our new surroundings.
