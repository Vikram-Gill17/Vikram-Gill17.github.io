Completing the Excel Course
Completing the Excel course has been transformative. I mastered cell referencing, tables, borders, basic functions, sorting, filtering, date and time, and If Else statements. Additionally, I learned about substrings, text data, rounding off, conditional formatting, data mapping, offset and dropdown, data aggregation, and data visualization. The course also covered creating and customizing charts. These skills have enhanced my data management and analysis capabilities significantly.
