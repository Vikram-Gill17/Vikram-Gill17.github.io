At the onset of the day, the college  would kick off by opening with a class on Universal Human Values to put a thoughtful spin on the morning. Then we used the 30-minute time we had to have a closer look at the elongated campus and all of its facilities. Then, it was time for the peer interaction which took place until 12:30 PM, where our second-year senior wanted to present to us the college's methods of assessment, clubs, and activities. The session was useful and made us feel closer to the college community. Then we finalized the day and went home, being happy and more confident about our academic time in the college.
